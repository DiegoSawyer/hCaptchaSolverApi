## Enough talk? where is my API?

1. **[Register for Free trial credits and API key](https://solve.shimul.me/register)** ~ 1000/mon
2. apikey uid sent to email

## How to use API? or How to solve captchas?

**special notes**: 
* We expect users to have some programming knowledge, as this is just not plug and play. This is not a UI based software interface but data receiver and transmitter API for anyone to use in client side code, server side code, GUI desktop or web apps, CLI tools. This API needs some data from user end to solve the captcha's. 
* Some troubleshooting and patience is required. Take some time to read the docs here and in¬†/usage_examples¬†of this repo. Most of them are updated.
* `doc` folders are not updated, head over to our discord channel to connect and discuss issues
********
0.0 not a step but this code runs in our mind if you ‚≠ê this repo <3

```
function youCool(){
  document.queryselector("#stargazers").addeventLister("click", 
   () => {
    console.log("you're amazing")
})}
```

1. You need `uid`, `apikey` from email we sent

2. Use our solving http endpoint:
   ```
   https://solve.shimul.me/api/solve/
   ``` 
3. Access target hcaptcha challenge images and convert them to valid image hash of `base64` ([how?](https://duckduckgo.com/?hps=1&q=converting+image+to+base64+stackoverflow&ia=web))

4. Store the base64 hashes you converted in step 3 in variables on your platform/language you're using.

5. Follow below code block for the¬†`JSON`¬†you need to send to our endpoint, max 18 image hashes are accepted.

   * `target` = the text you see on hcaptcha popup describing the challenge
   * `method` = our internal param so keep as it is
   * `site` = your target domain
   * `sitekey` = find the sitekey on your target html page: ``` <div class="h-captcha" data-sitekey="your_site_key"></div>```
   * note: sitekey and site info collected to improve accuracy. we respect privacy.
   
```
{
  "images": {
    "0": "1st base64 image hash",
    "1": "if another base64 hash",
    "2": "if another base64 hash",
    "3": "if another base64 hash",
    "4": "if another base64 hash",
    "5": "if another base64 hash",
    "6": "if another base64 hash",
    "7": "if another base64 hash",
    "8": "if another base64 hash",
    "9": "if another base64 hash",
    "10": "if another base64 hash",
    "11": "if another base64 hash",
    "12": "if another base64 hash",
    "13": "if another base64 hash",
    "14": "if another base64 hash",
    "15": "if another base64 hash",
    "16": "if another base64 hash",
    "17": "if another base64 hash",
    "18": "max 18 base64 hash"
  },
  "target": "Please click each image containing an airplane",
  "method": "hcaptcha_base64",
  "sitekey": "sitekey",
  "site": "site"
}

```

5. Test with Insomnia, postman or a REST API client to check if youre sending valid JSON like above, look at response from our api, it'll tell you mostly if there's problem with format or such.

6. api response our server sends are self-explanatory, but if you're stuck google

7. send request, if solved, you see something like this. Where the numbers represent the¬†images¬†index as you sent in order.


```
{
    "processing_time": "1.27s",
    "solution": [
        1,
        3,
        4,
        6
    ],
    "status": "solved"
}
```
8. use above info to tell your code or UI based interface to select these images index from `solution` and send for submission.

9. you should now get your hcaptcha challenge solved by an automated Ai.

10. your did it, good job!
